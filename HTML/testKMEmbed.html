    In this example, we are loading KeymanWeb late.  If you focus on a control early (e.g. a search box),
    you may want to place the KeymanWeb code into the head instead, to ensure it is available by the
    time the user wants to start typing.

  <!--
    For desktop browsers, a script for the user interface must be inserted here.

    Standard UIs are toggle, button, float and toolbar.
    The toolbar UI is best for any page designed to support keyboards for
    a large number of languages.
