<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Before
inventing this alphabet I was facing some challenges or problems in
writing of Kinyarwanda language. First, I meet those challenges when
I was with inspiration to write some songs or poem in a different
time continuously. Like when I was saying <b>R(u)G(u)WA  </b>for
maybe RGWANDA I was writing it as <b>R(u)w(A) </b>for Rwanda which is
totally different in the way we speak it; other example is ligature
<b>TW</b> if you read this gihekane as it is written it will sound as
<b>T(u)WA </b>because is <b>Ta+Wa</b> but in good spoken Kinyarwanda
we say as <b>T(u)K(u)WA </b>for some word like <b>UGU T(u)K(u)WI 
</b>there I was found that in all ligatures (ibihekane) there is a
missing sound.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">One
day after finishing my secondary study, I was at Nairobi Kenya in
vacation and I found that they write <b>“CH” </b>where we write
only<b> “C”</b><b>(but we speak that sound the same.)</b> by
example in swahili  they write “<u>ch</u>anga moto”<b> </b>and us
we write “<u>c</u>ana itara” and also in the origin of that Latin
letter <b>C </b>it sound as <b>“SI” </b><b>or “se”</b><b>. </b>on
that case I found that the Latin alphabet cannot and will not fit any
of the Bantu language completely as it sounds.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
found that the bantu languages sound the same but written in
different ways because of Latin alphabet we use which is not
compatible with our sound speaking at all.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">After
my vacation I returned at home to study at university of Rwanda in
computer science with those writing challenges I have faced before
visiting Kenya and with those writing challenges I have faced in
Kenya. At that time, I was started to wish that the bantu languages
should have their writing system.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Back
in the days in 2014, the writing of Kinyarwanda have been changed and
that change was a great conflict among citizen also those changes
have been corrected in 2020 but all those conflicts and changes are
because of Latinization of our language, here I may say that it is
wrong to assign one letter to different sound that why I may say:
those change and their corrections are all wrong because by example
we assign letter <b>K </b>to Q[iya] for sounding Kigali as like
icyibo and assign <b>K</b> to K[ah] for sounding kanombe , so if you
listen correctly you may hear there are different sound that why they
have to have different letter for each sound, I mean letter for
Q[iya] and other for k[ah]. .</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
reason behind all of this conflict and changes it is in history
because we are taught to write Kinyarwanda by our colonizer who come
to us without knowing our language. So, I would ask you as I always
was ask myself, how can someone who doesn’t know to speak your
language can teach you to write your language? Mission impossible.
That why my wish was to develop our own writing system.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">On
my research I have found that the Kinyarwanda language is a language
spoken by all Rwandan as easy spoken language but I found that it is
very hard to write it to all Rwandans. Many Rwandan from primary to
secondary the Kinyarwanda script challenge them especially in writing
of Kinyarwanda ligatures (ibihekane).  But the problem is not in
IBIHEKANE only but also, we use a character of different sound as a
sound of Kinyarwanda example we use letter C which sound originally
like si and we use it as sound cah of our language. We use vowel E
which sound originally like ih and we use it as sound eh of our
language and also in latin alphabet of our language we write some
sound as it is igihekane(ligature)but it is not if you listen
correctly you may hear it as a single sound I mean only 1 letter .</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
have examine many people of different generation by telling them like
please write for me IGIHEKANE shy (not only this, it is random
example) but many of them fail and those write as we studied they
start to think if what they think is correct or not means they write
it without a confidence. Because we write as not, we speak. So if we
write as we speak, to write any character or IBIHEKANE it will not be
something to think about.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
you listen on that SHY it is only a single character not combined
characters or ligature</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">that
the protection of any culture is in its language and protection of
any language is in it writing, umwero is to protect our language as
well as our culture.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Umwero
means a harvest time so, it is a harvest for us to raise our language
from vanishing to protection and also is the best step to strengthen
our national identity.</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
of umwero symbols are based on our culture example is it letter for
sound AH<b>(a)</b> which looks like a cow’s head as you know cows
was one among the pillars of ancient Rwanda kingdom (Kalinga)

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> The
artistic principle to develop each character was based on the middle
joint of every glyph to connect them all; on calligraph is based on
like 7cm and the joint is located on third cm (joint is shown by that
arrow shape).</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">some
of umwero symbols contain a spiritual meaning and many others are
just my normal imagination based on that calligraphic and artistic
principle of the joint and measures.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Example
of pictured umwero written word which means “imana ndayikunda kuko
niyo data”</p>
