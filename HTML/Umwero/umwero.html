<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Before
inventing this alphabet, I was facing some challenges or problems in
writing of Kinyarwanda language. First, I met those challenges when
I was inspired to write some songs or poems in a completely different
time. Like when I was saying <b>R(u)G(u)WA</b> for
maybe RGWANDA I was writing it as <b>R(u)w(A)</b>for Rwanda, which is
totally different in the way we speak it. Another example is the ligature
	<b>TW</b>. If you read <i>gihekane</i> as it is written, it will sound as
<b>T(u)WA </b>because it is <b>Ta+Wa</b>. But in good spoken Kinyarwanda,
we say  <b>T(u)K(u)WA</b> for a word like <b>UGU T(u)K(u)WI
</b>.There I found that in all ligatures (ibihekane) there is a
missing sound.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">One
day after finishing my secondary study, I was in Nairobi, Kenya on
vacation. I found that people there write <b>“CH” </b>where we write
only<b> “C”</b> (but we say that sound the same way.) For
example, in Swahili they write “<u>ch</u>anga moto”<b>and</b>
we write “<u>c</u>ana itara”. Also in the origin of that Latin
letter <b>C</b> it sounds as <b>“SI” </b> or <b>“se”</b>. </p>In
that case I found that the Latin alphabet cannot and will not fit any
of the Bantu languages completely as they are pronounced.
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
found that the Bantu languages sound the same but are written in
different ways because the Latin alphabet that we use which is not
compatible with our sound speaking at all.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">After
my vacation, I returned home to study at the University of Rwanda in
computer science, looking at those writing challenges I had faced before
visiting Kenya and with those writing challenges I also faced in
Kenya. At that time, I started to wish that the Bantu languages
would have their writing system.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Back
Since the days in 2014, writing of Kinyarwanda has been changed and
that change has been a great problem for citizen. Also those changes
were corrected in 2020 but all those conflicts and changes are
because of Latinization of our language. Here I may say that it is
wrong to assign one letter to different sounds. That is why I may say:
those changes and their corrections are all wrong. For example,
we assign letter <b>K </b>to Q[iya] for sounding Kigali as in
icyibo. We assign <b>K</b> to K[ah] for sounding kanombe , so if you
listen correctly, you may hear that there are different sounds. That is why they
have to have different letters for each sound, I mean letter for
Q[iya] and other for k[ah]. .</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
reason behind all of this conflict and changes is in history.
This is because we are taught to write Kinyarwanda by our colonizer who came
to us without knowing our language. So, I would ask you as I always
was asking myself, how can someone who doesn’t know to speak your
	language teach you to write your language? <i>Mission impossible.</i>
That why my wish was to develop our own writing system.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
my research, I have found that the Kinyarwanda language is a language
spoken by all Rwandan as an easily spoken language, but I found that it is
very hard for all Rwandans to write it. Many Rwandans from primary to
secondary are challenged by the Kinyarwanda script, especially in writing
Kinyarwanda ligatures (ibihekane).  But the problem is not only in
IBIHEKANE but because we use a character of different sound as a
sound of Kinyarwanda. For example, when we use letter C which sounds originally
	like si but we also use it as the sound <i>cah</i> in our language. We use vowel E
	which sound originally like <i>ih</i> but we use it as sound <i>eh</i> of our
language. Also in latin alphabet, we write a certain
sound as it in <b>igihekane</b> (ligature), but it is not. If you listen
correctly, you may hear it as a single sound, I mean only 1 letter.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
have asked many people of different generation to
please write for me IGIHEKANE shy (not only this, whic is a random
example.)  However, many of them fail and those who write as we studied
start to think if what they think is correct or not. This means that they write
it without confidence. Because we do not write as we speak. So if we could
write as we speak, to write any character or IBIHEKANE will not be
something complicated to think about.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If you listen on that
	<i>SHY</i>, it is only a single character, not combined
characters or ligature<./p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Because
the protection of any culture is in its language and the protection of
	any language is in it writing, <b>umwero</b> is to protect our language as
well as our culture.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Umwero
means a harvest time, so it is a harvest for us to raise our language
from vanishing to protection and also it is the best step to strengthen
our national identity.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
	<i>umwero</i> symbols are based on our culture. For example the letter for
sound AH<b>(a)</b> looks like a cow’s head. As you know cows
was one among the pillars of then ancient Rwanda kingdom Kalinga.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> The
artistic principle to develop each character was based on the middle
joint of every glyph to connect them all; the calligraphy is based on
like 7cm and the joint is located on third cm (joint is shown by that
arrow shape).</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

its equal sign punctuation represents the name of alphabet <i>umwero</i>.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some
umwero symbols contain a spiritual meaning and many others are
just from my normal imagination based on that calligraphic and artistic
principle of the joint and measures.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Example
of pictured umwero written word which means “imana ndayikunda kuko
niyo data”</p>
